#README

This project serves two purposes:
1. To create a kanban board-esque, draggable to-do app that I can use to track my past, current, and future work for MRMV and beyond.
2. To expand my web programming and design skills to make top-tier web apps to complement my growing model design and development skills.

The main idea of this project is to create a four-pane "sticky note" web app to keep track of my work  "To Do", "Doing", "Under Review/In Governance", and "Done" items. Items will start on the "To do" pane and will be draggable (perhaps using a JS library called dragula that I have seen) as items go from in queue to doing to reviewed to done. The following items are "nice-to-haves" that I hope to implement in the future:
+ Quote of the day to appear as a Jumbotron above the kanban panes
+ Full unit test code coverage
+ Back-end database for saving items across use cases
+ Web server to stand up project outside of my own computer's C: drive
